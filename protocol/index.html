    <h1>Keybase Messaging Protocol</h1>

    <h2>Goals</h2>

    <p>
      We can't hope for perfect forward secrecy since Alice, Bob and Charlie are not all assumed to be online at once.
      Though protocols exist to achieve <a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2003/083">Non-Interactive Forward Secrecy</a>,
      they are experimental and challenging to implement. We certainly don't discourage others from trying it out, but
      it is beyond the scope of this protocol.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here are the goals we do hope to achieve:

      <ol>
        <li>At least a PGP-level of security: if all parties keep their keys protected, the conversation is secret 
            and resilient to forgery and impersation.</li>
        <li>Resilience to server compromise: if the server is compromised:
          <ol>
            <li>Guarantee #1 is still upheld.</li>
            <li>All thread metadata is still secret; the attacker can't discover who was involved in which conversations.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Weak repudiation: if any conversant in the thread has their private key compromised, and if the
         server is compromised, conversations older than a given timeout can still be repudiated.</li>
        <li>Weak forward secrecy: if the server is compromised, and if any number of conversants have their
         keys compromised, the adversary still cannot recover <em>deleted</em> messages.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Initializing the Thread, Client Side</h3>

    <p> 
      Alice wants to start up a conversation with Bob and Charlie.

      <ol>
        <li>Generates two random session keys:
          <ul>
            <li>$k_s$, a 256-bit AES key</li>
            <li>$k_m$, a 256-bit key used to maintain message integrity; it will be used as key to HMAC-SHA512.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>For each conversant, generate a random "write-token", the possesion of which will allow Alice, Bob
            and Charlie to post to the server as themselves.  Call these tokens $t_A$, $t_B$, and $t_C$.
            They are random 128-bit strings.</li>
        <li>Generates a thread ID: $i$</li>
        <li>Looks up public keys $K_A, K_B$ and $K_C$.</li>
        <li>Creates a "thread init message" for each of the three conversants:
          <ul>
            <li>$E_{K_A}([ [A,B,C], i, k_s, k_m, t_A ])$</li>
            <li>$E_{K_B}([ [A,B,C], i, k_s, k_m, t_B ])$</li>
            <li>$E_{K_C}([ [A,B,C], i, k_s, k_m, t_C ])$</li>
          </ul>
          Note that Alice can use PGP messages for this, but she ought to strip out the exterior part of the 
          message that identifies which public key the message is intended for.  She should overwrite this part 
          of the message with <code>0</code> bytes.  She also should not sign the message.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sends these messages to the server, along with the message $[i, t_A, t_B, t_C]$
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2: Initializing the Thread, Server side</h3>

    <p>
      The server receives the message Alice send in the previous Step.  The server writes this information to the database
      and reserve slots for users $U_0, U_1$ and $U_2$ in conversation $i$.  Note that $U_0, U_1$ and $U_2$ are
      the server's pseudoynms for $A$, $B$ and $C$ on the clients. The server doesn't know the identities of Alice, Bob 
      or Charlie, so it can't refer to them as $A$, $B$, or $C$.
    </p>
    <p>
      By convention, the clients should always order user IDs from least to highest UID, to that way the correspondence
      of $A$ to $U_0$, etc, is agreed upon by all conversants and the server.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 3: Notification</h3>

    <p>
      Alice now needs to notify Bob and Charlie that they should check for messages on the server.
      She really only needs to send them $i$, and can do so in the clear or protected with crypto.
      However, the question is how best can she do this?
    </p>
    <p>
      We leave this stage of the protocol open to implentors.  In our implementation, the notification server
      is the same server as the relay server in Step 2. However, the server never writes notification data
      to disk, and therefore, an adversary who captures the server after the conversation ended can't determine
      who $U_0, U_1 and U_2$ are.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 3: Key Establishment</h3>

    <p>
      Bob, Charlie (and Alice if she switched machines) query the server for $[i,j]$, where $j$ is their position
      in the relative order of user IDs. The server replies with the $j$th encrypted message in conversation $i$
      that Alice sent in Step 1.  They can now decrypt and recover $k_s, k_m$.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 4: Authentication</h3>

    <p>
      Any user in the conversation can optionally prove their identity and authenticate their messages in the
      conversation.  Without this guarantee, Alice, Bob and Charlie can still converse, but they have no guarantee
      that they are conversing with authentic people.
    </p>

    <p>
      Authentication is the same for all conversants, but take Bob for example:
      <ol>
        <li>Bob generates a temporary keypair: $k'_{B}, K'_{B}$</li>
        <li>Bob generates a signature $s = \sigma_{k_{B}}([i, K'_{B}])$</li>
        <li>Bob encrypts $e = E_{k_s,k_m}([K'_{B}, s])$. Here $E_{k_s,k_m}$ is AES-256 encryption with key $k_s$ in CTR mode,
            and MACed with HMAC-SHA512 on key $k_m$.</li>
        <li>Bob sends $[i, t_B, m]$ to the server</li>
        <li>The server will only allow this signature to be posted if $t_B$ matches the "write token" that Alice
            established for Bob in Step 1.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      Once Bob has posted this message to the server, all conversants can retrieve it, and verify Bob's signature.
      Once they do, they have Bob's temporary public key $K'_{B}$.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 5: Sending Messages</h3>

    <p>
      When Bob wants to send a message $m$ to the group, he computes: $E_{k_s,k_m}([m, \sigma_{k'_{B}}([i, m])]).
      That is, he signs the message he wants to post with his temporary signing key, then encrypts using
      the session key for this conversation.
    </p>
